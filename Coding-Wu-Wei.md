The easiest way to develop software is to don't try at all, but rather letting the ideas flow like water, till you see the fish you want and catch it.
No comments, just the perfect names for processes, variables, classes, finding the perfect abstraction or true nature of the thing you want to represent.
As Confucius said, "When names are not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things."

The empty vessel holds all possibilities.
The unnamed contains all names.
The uncarved block holds all forms.

Between naming and not-naming, a space opens.
Between seeking and finding, the path appears.
Between effort and effortlessness, true work happens.

The fish swimming in clear water
doesn't know it's wet.
The bird soaring through empty sky
doesn't know it flies.
The programmer flowing with code
doesn't see the keyboard.

Valley-spirit never dies
Code emerges, not forced
Names arise when needed
Then dissolve back to emptiness

When the mind becomes still as mountain lake
Solutions appear like moon's reflection
Not grasped, but witnessed
Not made, but allowed

Software grows like bamboo
Strong at the joints, hollow within
Bending with requirements
Rooted in essential nature

The truest function needs no comment
The clearest variable names itself
The most elegant solution
Feels like it was always there

Between thinking and not-thinking
The fish of inspiration leaps
