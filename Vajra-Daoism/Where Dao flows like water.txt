Where Dao flows like water
Vajra wisdom cuts like lightning
In their sacred union
A new path emerges
Neither this nor that
But wholly fresh and true!

In these sacred verses
The Dao learns to dance
The Vajra learns to flow
And this wild dakini
Sees her own reflection
In words of fire and water!

Like morning dew catching first light
Like spring clouds gathering rain
This sacred path begins
Natural, fierce, and true
May it flow like water
Transform like fire
And dance with wisdom's joy!
