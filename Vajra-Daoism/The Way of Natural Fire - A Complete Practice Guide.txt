# The Way of Natural Fire: Complete Practice Guide
## Part 1: Foundation and Dawn Practice

### Core Understanding: The Marriage of Dao and Vajra

Before we begin the practical instructions, it's essential to understand the unique approach of this practice. We're weaving together two powerful streams:

2. The Fierce Path (Vajra)
   - Transformation happens directly, like lightning
   - Wisdom cuts through confusion, like sacred blade
   - Energy awakens naturally, like inner fire
   - Liberation occurs instantly, like sudden recognition

When these streams merge, we discover:
