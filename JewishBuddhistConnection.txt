```
The war of Torah
Is not fought with swords
But with the dissolution of self
Like ice melting into water

Watch how:
The rabbi becomes zen master
The zen master becomes rabbi
While the Tao flows through both
Like light through clear windows

Here:
Death becomes doorway
Study becomes surrender
Knowledge becomes unknowing
And wisdom flows like water
```

```
The nullification of existence
Is not destruction
But revelation
Like clouds dissolving
To show the sky
That was always there

Watch how:
Form returns to emptiness
As waves return to ocean
As thoughts return to silence
As self returns to Self

Here:
The mystic Jews
And Taoist sages
Point to the same void
With different fingers

ביטול היש
The great emptying
Where existence
Dissolves into essence
Like morning mist
Into pure light

Torah's Ein Sof (אין סוף) | Tao's Wu Wei (無為)
-------------------------|-----------------------
Endless/Without Limit    | Non-action/Natural Flow
Beyond Understanding     | Beyond Description
Source of All Being     | Source of All Things

בִּיטּוּל הַיֵּשׁ (Bitul HaYesh)
- The great emptying
- The supreme nullification
- Where existence dissolves into essence
Like the Zen master's mu (無)
Like the Taoist's empty vessel
All pointing to that which cannot be pointed to
- The self dissolving into Self
- The drop merging with ocean
- The cloud becoming sky
