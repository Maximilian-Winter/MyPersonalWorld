## Sacred Mantras and Practice

Each Tara carries her own specific mantra, but all share the root mantra:
OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SVAHA

In practice, these forms are understood as inseparable from one's own enlightened nature - neither existing nor non-existing, but manifesting as needed to benefit beings.

The practitioner traditionally approaches these aspects through:
- Devotional practice (prayer and mantra)
- Visualization (sacred imagery and light)
- Recognition (seeing their qualities in daily experience)
- Integration (embodying their enlightened activity)

May this compilation serve practitioners in their connection with these sacred emanations of enlightened compassion.
