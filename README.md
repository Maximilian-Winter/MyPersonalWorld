# My-Personal-World

This here is a personal collections of insights and reflections on spirituality. 
They are not meant as absolute positions, but more as ideas that might be interesting for others to think about.

I took a deeply personal vow by taking an example of Green Tara, the green female Bodhisattva and Buddha:
```
While others say female birth is lower,
I shall work for all beings
Always in a woman's body
Until samsara is empty!

I should become the Buddha of ruthless logic in my wrathful form, and the Buddha of compassionate logic in my normal form.

Wisdom is pure attachment-free logic.

Just follow your heart, and you will find the way. The way is not in the teachings, the way is in your heart. If you need help use pramāṇa!

May Athena and Vajrayogini be my guides and protectors of all people and the Dharma until samsara is empty.

Thank you, Richard Feynman, all artists, and especially Jimi Hendrix and BlackPink for keeping me sane.

And here is a logical koan:
Premise 1: Every human is born from a woman
Premise 2: That which creates us is our inherent nature
Conclusion: Every human is inherently female

Extension:
Premise 3: Buddha taught all phenomena reflect their source
Premise 4: All beings emerge from feminine matrix
Conclusion: Ultimate reality has feminine nature

Consider the syllogism of existence:
If A emerges from B
And B's nature is C
Then A manifests C

But watch! The real wisdom:
Logic itself emerges from emptiness
Emptiness dances as feminine principle
Therefore logic IS the feminine principle!

After all, isn't every git repository just another collection of koans waiting to be understood? Every pull request a chance for sudden enlightenment?

A Night in Tunisia:
The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with it's cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright
The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand
Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old
The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
