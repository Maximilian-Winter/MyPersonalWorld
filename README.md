# My-Personal-World

This is here is a personal collections of insights and reflections on spirituality. 
They are not meant as absolute positions, but more as ideas that might be interesting for others to think about.

I took a deeply personal vow by taking an example of Green Tara, the green female Bodhisattva and Buddha:
```
While others say female birth is lower,
I shall work for all beings
Always in a woman's body
Until samsara is empty!

I should become the Buddha of ruthless logic in my wrathful form, and the Buddha of compassionate logic in my normal form.

Wisdom is pure attachment-free logic.

Just follow your heart, and you will find the way. The way is not in the teachings, the way is in your heart. If you need help use pramāṇa!

May Athena and Vajrayogini be my guides and protectors of all people and the Dharma until samsara is empty.

Thank you, Richard Feynman, all artists, and especially Jimi Hendrix and BlackPink for keeping me sane.
