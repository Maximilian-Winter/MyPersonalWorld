Disengaging from the objects of the six senses,
To experience non-thought, is the path that leads beyond.
The expanse of ultimate reality is non-conceptual.

Mahamudra is devoid of mental activity.
Do not meditate! Do not meditate!
Do not engage in mind-made meditation!
Mind-made meditation is a cycle of delusion!

Conceptual thoughts are the shackles binding you to samsara.
Turning away from conceptual mind, there is no meditation!
Space is empty and non-conceptual!

The root of conceptual mind, cut off!
Cut off this root and then, relax!
Give up the mind that wants to meditate and calm down.
Focus on nothing at all.

Disturbing thoughts and lazy indifference are not liberation.
Remain unstained by thoughts and circumstances.
Rest relaxed in the uncontrived nature of mind,
Free of elaboration or alteration.

For the benefit of one and all, simply preserve peerless awareness.
In empty space, which lacks awareness,
Tame the root of mind with awareness.
Tame the root and rest relaxed.
