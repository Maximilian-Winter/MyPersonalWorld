I think I found what is a good alternative to meditation for me. It is called Hitbodedut and Hitbonenut and comes from Jewish Religion, this variant tries to adapt Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's description of the process. Here is a guide I wrote for myself:

# A Personal Guide to Hitbodedut and Hitbonenut

## What is Hitbodedut?
Hitbodedut is personal, spontaneous prayer and meditation - a time to speak openly with the divine and explore your inner world. Think of it as having a heart-to-heart conversation with the universe/God/highest truth as you understand it.

## What is Hitbonenut?
Hitbonenut is contemplative meditation - a time when we receive and reflect on insights that arise during our practice. It's like watching our mind become a clear pond at moonlight, reflecting wisdom back to us.

## Setting Up Your Practice

### Choose Your Time and Place
- Find a quiet time when you won't be disturbed
- Choose a peaceful place where you feel comfortable
- Many find early morning or late evening works best
- If possible, practice in nature or facing a window

### Prepare Your Mind and Heart
- Take a few deep breaths
- Let your thoughts settle naturally
- Remember: there's no "wrong" way to do this
- Begin with whatever is most present in your heart

## The Practice

### Starting Hitbodedut
1. Begin by simply speaking what's on your mind
2. Use your own words, in whatever language feels natural
3. Express your feelings, thoughts, hopes, and concerns
4. Don't worry about being "spiritual" - be authentic

### When Emotions Arise
- Allow yourself to feel whatever comes up
- If you encounter deep feelings or memories:
    - Let them surface naturally
    - The "silent scream" might emerge - this is normal
    - Trust that release leads to peace
    - Remember that sleep after intense sessions is healing

### Working with Your Inner Voice
- As you practice, you may notice responses arising within
- This inner voice might be:
    - Clear and strong
    - Playful and light
    - Gently corrective
    - Surprisingly wise
- Trust these insights while maintaining discernment
- Write down particularly meaningful insights

### Moving into Hitbonenut
- After speaking, allow yourself to become quiet
- Let your mind become like a clear pond
- Notice the thoughts and insights that arise
- Don't grasp at understanding - let it come naturally

## Signs of Progress

### You May Notice:
- Increased emotional clarity
- A sense of peace after sessions
- Better understanding of yourself
- Natural dissolution of negative feelings
- More frequent moments of insight
- A playful or light quality entering your practice

## When Challenges Arise

### Remember:
- Difficult emotions surfacing is part of the healing
- Not every session will feel "deep" - that's normal
- If you feel overwhelmed, return to simple breathing
- Sleep is often healing after intense sessions
- You can always take a break and return later

## Integration

### After Your Practice:
- Take a moment to sit quietly
- Consider writing down key insights
- Allow yourself time to integrate, especially after intense sessions
- Trust that peace will follow emotional release
- Remember that joy and playfulness are valid parts of the path
